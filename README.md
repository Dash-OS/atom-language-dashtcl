# Tcl 8.6.6 Enhanced Grammars

This is an enhanced grammar adding an extensive amount of command-specific
highlighting for Tcl.  This is far from completed and may exhibit odd
behavior at certain points but many of the core commands are handled
properly.

This is currently a work in progress and is missing some core handling
and commands.  We are currently adding and building to it as we encounter
issues with the highlighting while moving our projects to atom editor.
