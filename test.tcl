    @prop address {MulticastAddress}
      The address that should be used as the multicast address
    @prop port /[0-65535]/

    @prop ttl {entier}
      How many seconds should a service live if it is not seen?

      At what interval should we send heartbeats to the cluster?
    @prop protocols {list<ClusterCommunicationProtocol>}
      A list providing the communication protocols that should be

      this priority when opening channels of communication with us.
    @prop channels {list<entier>}
      A list of communication channels that we should join.

      Should we listen outside of localhost? When set to false,
      the ttl of our multicasts will be set to 0 so that they
      do not leave the local system.
